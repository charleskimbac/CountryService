  "description": "Roact Motion is a library built for specific use within the Roact framework. It was inspired in Flipper, Framer Motion (from React) and the TweenService. These 3 different libraries together along with my need for a proper solution when it comes to animating React brought this library to live! We'll be learning today how to install, get started and use this library to its full potential!",
