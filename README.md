# Docusaurus MoonWave Template


## ðŸ¤“Introduction

  

This is a simple template that allows you to easily document your code. The reason why I created it was because MoonWave by default only generates the API section and nothing else. The only way you could add more content to your page would be by manually modifying Docusaurus which requires a decent background with this tool. I thought that no one should be forced to dive deep into Docusaurus usage and configurations so I made this template that allows you to skip that extensive step and start writing what matters!

  
## ðŸ”¨Tools used

There are 3 tools being used within this template. Make sure to read about the 3 of them in order to properly use this template!

NodeJS is a simple framework that allows you to run javascript on your own machine instead of limiting it to the web! A lot of people use it to build tools to help their workflow and this is exactly what both docusaurus and MoonWave do. Make sure to download it before jumping into the tutorial.

Docusaurus is a NodeJS tool that allows you to make documentation websites without any effort! It allows you to use MD files such as this one to describe your code making it a very powerful tool to have.

MoonWave is a tool that allows you to transform Luau code into a docusaurus website in a single line of code! This makes writing APIs 100 times faster and much more straightforward. Make sure to read about all of the features it provides in the following link.

## ðŸ“–Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll be learning how to set up this template step by step and get it to work as soon as possible! If you have any questions or believe this tutorial could be improved make sure to contact Vasco!


### 1. Download the repository

It doesn't really matter too much if you either clone or download the repo but I would personally recommend downloading it since you probably don't want to make a branch within this repository just to build your own website.

<img  height="350px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085176959560065034/image.png"/>


### 2. Install dependencies

Once you have a copy of this template you should install all the dependencies needed for it to work. Open the command line **inside** of the directory of the template that you just downloaded and run the following commands.


>:warning: **These commands require NodeJS 14+**: [Download now](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```powershell

npm install

```

>:information_source: **This command globally installs MoonWave. Not required if you already have MoonWave installed**

```powershell

npm i -g moonwave@latest

```


<img  height="350px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085180557585043567/image.png"/>


### 3. Generate MoonWave Build

First, you need to make sure your code can be generated by MoonWave into a proper web build. To learn about how to make MoonWave APIs please read the following website: [Getting Started with Moonwave | Moonwave (eryn.io)](https://eryn.io/moonwave/docs/intro). Here you will learn how to set up your code to use MoonWave very quickly. But in a very short summary, MoonWave grabs the comments from your code and turns them into readable documentation.


**Example:**

```lua

--[=[

This class can do stuff!

@class myClass

]=]

local  myClass = {}

  

--[=[

This function does cool stuff!

@param text string -- This is the text the function will receive!

@return number

]=]

function  myClass:Print(text: string): number

return  2

end

```

Once you have finished setting up your code for MoonWave you want to open the terminal inside of the project directory and run the following command:

```powershell

moonwave dev

```

This will generate the moonwave folder and will let you know where it was generated (if on Windows it should be on the AppData cache).


<img  height="50px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085172080204578846/image.png"/>


You now want to copy this directory (under lined in red).


### 4. Find and Copy MoonWave data files

Now that the MoonWave data has been generated we want to import it into our template. To do this you should now open File Explorer and paste in the path that we just copied.


<img  height="250px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085172265257283684/image.png"/>
<img  height="250px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085172364314161202/image.png"/>


Once pasted in just press enter and you will find yourself within the location at which MoonWave generated the data!

Now here we want to go into the .docusaurus folder as this is where the important data was stored. Inside this folder we want to copy 2 folders:


<img  height="250px"  src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670023265455964198/1085172707978645514/image.png"/>

``docusaurus-plugin-debug and docusaurus-plugin-moonwave``


### 5. Import the MoonWave data

Great, now that we know where to find the data and we copied it we can finally paste it into our template. Just go into the template directory and paste these 2 folders inside the .docusaurus folder. It will ask you if you wish to replace the existing files, just press yes.


### 6. Preview website

After all of this hardwork, you are probably excited to see what it looks like I'd assume at least. To preview the website all you need to do is open the terminal in the template folder and run the following command:

```powershell

npm run start

```

or

```powershell

npm start

```

This will open a preview of the website right away at the local host on port 3001.

You can now explore the website and see the whole API straight from MoonWave on your brand-new website! Now it's time to configure the website and write some tutorials to help other developers using your library or framework.


### 7. Configure website

Inside the template folder, there is a file by the name of **gamefam.config.js**. Open this file with whatever editor you prefer and change the variables to fit your content the best.

| Variable Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| PROJECT_NAME | This is the name of your project, for displaying purposes only |
| PROJECT_ROOT | The name of your repository so that it can link to its GitHub |
| TAG_LINE | This is the tagline of your website |
| AUTHORS_NAMES | An array with the names of every single person that has worked on this library/framework |
| BUTTON_TEXT | This is the text that will be written at the button on the landing page |
| DEVELOPERS_ICON | This is an icon you can add either of yourself or you and your other developers to display on the landing page! It's completely optional |
| LIBRARY_LOGO | If you have a logo you should write the image link here for it to be displayed on the landing page of the website |


### 8. Write tutorials

Once you're done setting up the template with the steps above you are now ready to write some tutorials! The way you write them is by creating.MD files (such as this one) in the docs folder and edit them to fit your needs. You can check the examples I wrote inside the template as a reference. For more information about what you can do within the MD file just check the docusaurus API about this topic as docusaurus allows you to do a lot of extra things that you cannot do in a regular MD file.

### 9. Build website

Once you're done with everything you can just open the terminal within the template folder and run the following command:

```powershell

npm run build

```

This will generate a build that you can then publish on whatever host you wish!


### 10. Publish

To publish the website I'd recommend talking to **Velibor#8251** on Discord. He is currently the responsible person for the company documentation hosting.


## Tips and tricks


### How to open a terminal in a specific directory

There are 2 easy ways to open a terminal in a specific directory.

#### 1. Opening thru file explorer

This is my favorite way to open the cmd. Just go to the file explorer, open the folder your wish, and then write "cmd" and press enter.

#### 2. CD into the directory

### Update API

You can just go over steps #4 and #5 whenever you wish to update the API of the website. It won't break any of the existing code or written content of your website.


### Luau Support

I coded some basic Luau support into this template, in order to use it just write the code block with the luau tag

```

\```luau

Code goes here

\```

```
